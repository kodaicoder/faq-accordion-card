## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

This is my first project with Tailwind CSS , searching hard on the internet and learning a lot of thing in Tailwind CSS , specially Arbitrary values and peer-{modifier} save me a lot of times

and some new HTML tag like `<details>` but finally I quit using that tag because of lagging of animation that require JavaScript to made it smooth and back to basic using custom checkbox input to doing a trick with a Tailwind CSS

Finally , IT'S A LIVE !!

also I still open for warming suggestion and still have a lot of thing to learning in React , Tailwind , ETC.

BONUS‚≠ê is a component of FAQ accordion build with `<details>` that I has try but not success üòâ

```
peer-checked:[&>span]
is like "input:checked label>span" in vanilla CSS
that will made nested child can access to peer class too
```

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Documents](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/) - yah just a documents for telling me how to using Tailwind CSS.
- [Access to all child with Tailwind CSS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67119992/how-to-access-all-the-direct-children-of-a-div-in-tailwindcss) - definitely it has this command on documents of tailwind itself but lacking of use case.
- [Why not using <details>](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-animate-the-details-element-using-waapi/) - I didn't using `<details>` because it need some time to effort to JavaScript and that not my objective on this project. (need to using only CSS to control accordion)
- [Custom scroll bar](https://codepen.io/stephenpaton-tech/full/JjRvGmY) - Custom scroll bar for looking good UI experience. (Credit:[Stephen Paton](https://stephenpaton.tech/))
- [Overlap two image on each other](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-position-one-image-on-top-of-another-in-html-css.html) - this will tell you how to position one image on top of another in HTML/CSS.
